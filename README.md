# Hotel Reservation
This is a Hotel Reservation Application exercise that is written using Java. Using this application, you can book a room as a regular User, and also get the list of your own reservations. If you enter using the Administrator profile, you perform a search of the whole list of Rooms, list of Clients, or even add new Rooms to the inventory. This application performs a basic set of tasks that are useful to a (very) small hotel.
